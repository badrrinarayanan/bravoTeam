# ADR-004: Candidate preferred timeslot

## Date:
2025-03-25

## Status:
Proposed

## Context:
Our system requires preferred interview time slot to be selected by the candidate to continue with the interview scheduling.

## Decision:
We will be sending the candidate a list if chosen timeslots and expect the candidate to select one of the timeslots.

## Consequences:
Without candidate's preferred timeslot, we would not be able to schedule the interview.

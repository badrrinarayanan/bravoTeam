# ADR-001: External systems

## Date:
2025-03-15

## Status:
Proposed

## Context:
In order to develop our overall Architecture, we needed to make some assumptions regarding the behaviour external systems like Greenhouse, GoodTime, LeavePlanner, Jigsaw and Zoom.

## Decision:
We are assuming that whatever API our system needs will be available or will be added in the external systems.

## Consequences:
All our architecture has been developed keeping this in mind
